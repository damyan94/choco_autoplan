# This file should contain information about the types, numbers and volumes of conches available on the line.
# The count (n) and order in column "type" is important for the "masses_cfg.txt" file:
#   - there you have two columns containing mass types and max storage capacities;
#   - always start from 0 and increment each new type accordingly;
#   - the following columns are n columns for refining times and n columns for conching times;
#   - if you have defined two types of conches here, there MUST be two columns for refining times and two columns for conching times;
#   - this order also matches the order in which the conches will be populated with masses when the program is executed.
